# FreeRTOS Tutorials and Practice Projects

This repository contains my personal notes, example projects, and practical exercises created while studying the *FreeRTOS**:  
🎓 *"RTOS: Build Real-Time Embedded Applications with FreeRTOS. Practice on STM32  Board."*

## 🧠 Overview

This repository serves as a **learning archive and hands-on guide** for understanding and practicing key FreeRTOS concepts on embedded systems.  
Each folder represents a separate tutorial or experiment, focusing on a specific RTOS feature or mechanism.

The examples are implemented mainly on:
- **STM32 microcontrollers** (using STM32CubeIDE / HAL drivers)


## ⚙️ Development Setup

To run or modify these examples, you’ll need:

### 🧩 For STM32 boards:
- **IDE:** STM32CubeIDE  
- **Board:** STM32F4 series (e.g., Nucleo-F446RE / Discovery boards)  
- **Drivers:** STM32 HAL / CMSIS  


Each example may include a project file or source code ready to import into the respective IDE.

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

Through these examples, you can learn and practice:
- Creating and managing FreeRTOS tasks  
- Inter-task communication (queues, semaphores, event groups, task notifications)  
- Priority management and scheduling  
- Working with ISRs and RTOS-safe APIs  
- Using software timers  
- Applying synchronization mechanisms  
- Integrating FreeRTOS with CMSIS-RTOS
